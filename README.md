The code for the Android client is in the 'android' subfolder. You'll need to add in keys/tokens/IDs for a Parse app, a Facebook app and, optionally, a Crashlytics app for full functionality.

Parse Backend

The code for the Parse backend is in the 'parse' subfolder. You'll need to add in your application ID and master key into /config/global.json.
