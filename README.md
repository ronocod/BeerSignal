A simple alert-sending app, powered by Parse.

Android Client

The code for the Android client is in the 'android' subfolder. You'll need to add in keys/tokens/IDs for a Parse app, a Facebook app and, optionally, a Crashlytics app for full functionality.

I'll be uploading the source code for the Parse app soon.
